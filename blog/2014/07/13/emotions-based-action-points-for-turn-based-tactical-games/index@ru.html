</p>      Bits and Pieces                                     Emotions-based Action Points for Turn-based Tactical Games. Part 1                     emotional marbles, mechanics, raw idea, tactical games       A lot of modern tabletop role-playing games have some kind of mechanic to describe player character’s temper. Most importantly, to help fleshing it out. It helps players to have an initial idea of how to handle the narrative and the relations with other in-story entities(NPC). Additionally, such a system often has some substantial mechanical benefits and constraints.  The following post is an inconsistent ramble about a mechanical idea I was pondering about for some time: In a turn-based tactical game featuring a squad of characters to use character’s emotional state expressed in numerical format as action points.     So, a ramble:  Disposition: A squad of characters travels on a global map, occasionally breaking into a turn-based combat.  First example  Let’s assume that it is possible to influence character’s (both protagonists and antagonists) emotional state before the fight. For example, through dialogue.  In this simplest example there is two possible emotions tracked by the mechanic: calm and enraged. Each turn each character gets some points representing one or the other state of mind to spend on actions, the probability depending on his stats.  We have a team of two protagonists: Barbarian and Cleric.  Barbarian is an angry fighter-type, whose MO is smashing things. Among his possible actions, all being direct attacks, most need the player to pay with enraged points.  Cleric, on the other hand, needs to stay calm to pray to his god for divine interventions, but he can occasionally bash someone with a mace if he is enraged.  Both characters get some emotional points(marbles) they can spend on actions per turn. Barbarian’s probability of getting an enraged marble rather than calm is 6 to 1, for example, the Cleric’s is 1 to 3.  Being a poorly built character, Barbarian suffers if he occasionally gets a random calm point, because he has no use for it. What the player can do in this situation is: try to develop a character into having a use for them (communing with ancestor spirits mid-fight), or try to pump the character before the fights(“they spoke badly about your ancestors”) to improve the probability of him being enraged.
